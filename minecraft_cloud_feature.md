## Outdated Version Check
This feature automatically checks the plugin's versions and compares it to the Cloud database. This allows the ability to notify the user when they are using an outdated plugin version, because updating often is important. It doesn't collect any private information and is purely used for awareness purposes.

## Auto Updater
This feature is available to everyone for free. After you download your chosen product from the #my-account Discord text-channel, upload it to your server and the Auto Updater will enable automatically. The downloaded file may have some random characters in its name which you should not remove as they help our system identify your license and let the product continue working. 4 times in a year would be sufficient enough to keep using our Auto Updater as we expire our tokens after 3 months as a security measurement.
